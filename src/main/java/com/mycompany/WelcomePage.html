    <!--
    Case: View Show Label
    Case: Edit Show editable text box/ text field

    We can create two panel
        panel1: will have only label
        panel2: will have only textfield
    Based on the condition we will either add (display) panel1 or panel2

    But this approach requires lot of efforts (усилий):
    1) Create separate html for the two panels
    2) Create separate class for the two panels

    This will increase the number of files in your project and ultimately it will
    become difficult to maintain our project

    This approach is completely justified when you have complex components where user defined panels
    are the best approach.

    But what about the scenarios where we just need either a label or textfield,
    for scenarios like this, fragments is best approach. In short fragments are like in line panels.
